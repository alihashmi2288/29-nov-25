# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation
The primary goal is to write a textbook for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course using Docusaurus, deployed to GitHub Pages. The development will leverage Spec-Kit Plus and the Gemini CLI for content creation and overall project management. This textbook will include an integrated RAG chatbot.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development activities, including specifications, plans, and implementations, MUST adhere to it. Amendments require a documented proposal, review, and approval, followed by updating this document and propagating changes to all relevant templates.

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-29
