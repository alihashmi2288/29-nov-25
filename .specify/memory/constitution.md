# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation
The project's primary goal is to write a book using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Development will strictly follow the Spec-Kit Plus methodology (https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/) and utilize the Gemini CLI for all operations.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development activities, including specifications, plans, and implementations, MUST adhere to it. Amendments require a documented proposal, review, and approval, followed by updating this document and propagating changes to all relevant templates.
