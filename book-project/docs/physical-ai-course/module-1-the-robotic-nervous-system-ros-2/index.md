# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)"! In this module, we will delve into the fundamental middleware that powers modern robotic systems: the Robot Operating System 2. ROS 2 provides a flexible and powerful framework for building complex robot applications, enabling different components of a robot to communicate and collaborate seamlessly.

## Module Objectives

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:
*   Understand the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2.
*   Implement ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions in Python.
*   Describe how URDF is used to define robot kinematics and appearance.
*   Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using `rclpy`.
