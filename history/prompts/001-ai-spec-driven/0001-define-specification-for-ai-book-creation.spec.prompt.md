## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for 'AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation' and saved it to 'specs/001-ai-spec-driven/spec.md'. The specification includes user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Defined the scope and requirements for the new feature, providing a clear guide for development.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a documentation change.
- 📁 Files: 
  - Created: `specs/001-ai-spec-driven/spec.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with the `/sp.plan` command to create an architectural plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent correctly interpreted the implicit "continue" command as a request to proceed to the next logical step in the workflow (specification). The generated spec is comprehensive.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
