## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for 'AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation' and saved it to 'specs/001-ai-spec-driven/plan.md'. The plan outlines the technical approach, project structure, and technology stack.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a clear architectural and technical plan for the feature, aligning with the constitution and specification.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a documentation change.
- 📁 Files: 
  - Created: `specs/001-ai-spec-driven/plan.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with the `/sp.tasks` command to break down the plan into specific, actionable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent successfully transitioned from the spec phase to the plan phase, correctly interpreting the user's intent and populating the plan based on the established requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
