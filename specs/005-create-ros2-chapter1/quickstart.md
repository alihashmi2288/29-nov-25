# Quickstart: Creating the "Introduction to ROS 2" Chapter

This guide outlines the steps to create the "Introduction to ROS 2: Core Concepts and Architecture" chapter.

## 1. Create the Chapter File

Create a new file named `introduction-to-ros-2.md` in the `book-project/docs/physical-ai-course/` directory.

## 2. Add Content to the Chapter

Populate `introduction-to-ros-2.md` with the content from `specs/005-create-ros2-chapter1/research.md`. The content should be structured as a book chapter, with clear explanations, code examples, and diagrams where appropriate.

## 3. Update Docusaurus Sidebar

To make the chapter visible in the navigation, open the `book-project/sidebars.ts` file and add an entry for the chapter under the "Physical AI Course" category. For example:

```typescript
import type {SidebarsConfig} from '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs';

const sidebars: SidebarsConfig = {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    'intro',
    'preface',
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tutorial Basics',
      items: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'tutorial-basics'}],
    },
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tutorial Extras',
      items: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'tutorial-extras'}],
    },
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Physical AI Course',
      items: [
          {type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'physical-ai-course'},
          'physical-ai-course/introduction-to-ros-2' // Add this line
        ],
    },
  ],
};

export default sidebars;
```

## 4. Run Docusaurus Locally

To preview the changes, run the following commands from the `book-project` directory:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local development server and open up a browser window. You should be able to see the new chapter in the sidebar under the "Physical AI Course" category.

## 5. Commit and Push Changes

Once you are satisfied with the chapter, commit the changes to the `005-create-ros2-chapter1` branch and push them to the remote repository.
